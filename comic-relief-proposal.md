### Brief summary

*350 characters including spaces*

WizMe is a cross-disciplinary project involving art and technology. It is about
creating a small, social, friendly robot to help refugee children turn the
experience of their journey across the world into a powerful story that they
will be able to show and tell during their journey towards asylum.


### Please describe the people who would benefit and the problems they face in their lives

*3500 characters including spaces*

- the target group of this project is migrant children (8-18 years old), still
  on the route, but relatively close to their destination (for instance, close
  to the European border, or in transit inside the EU). We specifically plan to
  deliver the project in locations where ArtRefuge UK is actively working with
  children refugees (namely, safe-houses on the British-French border [or?]).
- the intervention is targeting children that stay a least a week in the camp or
  safe-house.
- for many of these children, the hope is to reach the UK. They face a long and
  difficult asylum seeking process.
- critical parts of this process rely on the children being able to recount the
  story of their life and journey to date. Critically, the story has to be
  perceived as *genuine* -- it is otherwise often dismissed by border
  enforcement forces as being fake (e.g. "you are only parroting what the
  smuggler told you to say!")
- proving that their story is genuine is incredibly difficult for these
  children: they might have very little -- if any -- physical evidence of their
  journey (typically, only pictures on their smartphones -- with smartphones
  often being destroyed or confiscated by intermediaries or police forces), but
  also the children lack the skills required to tell a story. They typically
  originate from small rural communities, and have had very limited need (or
  opportunity) to tell someone else the story of their daily lives in the rich
  and detailed manner expected from them when seeking asylum.
- asylum seekers are requested to tell their story multiple times on their
  pathway to asylum.  They will have to recount over and over again the same,
  often traumatic, journey. Compounded with stress and exhaustion, this often
  leads to small inconsistencies in the narration, that might be picked up to
  dismiss the whole case. In these situations, the balance of powers is gravely
  tilted in favour of the law enforcement agencies, with little options for the
  children to appeal.
- obtaining the refugee status is strongly linked to whether the child is at
  risk were he/she to return to their home country. Therefore, whilst requesting
  asylum, children will be assessed for weakness and vulnerability (rather than
  the strength/resilience they have shown on their journey). This process
  creates additional trauma evoked from needing to re-tell and justify their
  vulnerabilities and resultant need for asylum.

### What changes do you expect to see as result of your proposed work?

*3500 characters including spaces*

- the primary purpose of the project is to provide direct **support to the
  refugee children in their journey towards being granted asylum**.
- we want to achieve this by empowering the children: supporting them in
  building the story of their life and journey, and helping them in becoming the
  **confident and genuine storytellers** they need to be when narrating their
  story to institutions and government officers.
- by telling her/his story to the robot, the robot will also create a **digital
  record** of the journey, privately and securely stored, but available to the
  child as a future evidence, testimony of her/his life experience.
- By creating and providing the refugees a durable, secure and tamper-proof
  digital record of their lives, we aim at shifting the power to the asylum
  seekers: they will have *one*, *opposable* multi-media record that they can
  keep with them, and replay at will. The project team specifically includes a
  lawyer, Kathryn Cronin (specialised in refugees rights) who will advise on
  the legal aspects.
- also, positive impact on **mental health** of the children, at two levels:
  alleviating some of the stress of the asylum seeking process (with the digital
  record providing a trustworthy anchor); and providing comfort from the
  peaceful, non-judgmental, culturally-sensitive interactions with the robot.
- refugee children are asked to fit in a new identity, matching local
  norms/expectation, at the expense of their previous, original identity. This
  is a source of anxiety and suffering. Using carefully designed multi-modal
  interaction, the robot will invite the child to create her/his own narrative,
  using her/his cultural codes, **helping the children to secure their cultural
  identity**. Besides, by creating a lasting record of these story, the project
  contributes in build a **cultural legacy** for the refugees, both personal
  (*the story of their own journey*) and global (*testimonies of refugees'
  lives*)
- the project is also about collecting and recording the **individual stories of
  unique individuals**, not just 'the refugees'. By recording, and later,
  retelling those unique stories, the project will help the children to be aware
  and proud of their **own, individual identities**.
- beyond the immediate role of the robot in supporting the children during the
  asylum application process, the project aims more broadly at projecting a
  **positive light** on these children, with their own complex, rich stories.
  Properly disseminated, the collection of stories will play a critical role in
  documenting refugees lives and reaching out to a broader audience.


Section 2: Activities
=====================


### What specifically will you do to help people to address their identified problems?

*3500 characters including spaces*

WizMe is about creating a small, social, friendly robot to help refugee children
to turn the complex experience of their journey across the world into a powerful
story that they will be able to show and tell while seeking asylum.

The robots (we plan to build a total of five units over the course of the
project) will be used by field practitioners (primarily by ArtRefuge UK, with
possible extensions to other charities and NGOs) in refugee camps and safe-houses
across Europe to support the children. Supported by the staff, the robot and the
child engage into a non-threatening social interaction, in which the child is
invited, little by little, to recount her/his journey and personal life. The
duration and frequency of the interventions is flexible and would be tailored to
each child's needs; over the course of one to three weeks, we would typically
envision one 30-min long interaction every day.

Following the ArtRefuge approach, as well as the interactions created by Chlo√©
Meineck on her previous Trove project <https://bit.ly/2ZlZL5W>, the child is
invited to tell her/his story in many different way, using a variety of
supports: narration, drawings, paintings, plasticine, small toy figures, etc.
The robot records (pictures, videos, sounds) these representations, and also
actively engage with the child, showing curiosity, non-judgmental emotional
responses, and nudging the child to tell more, show more.

Critically, while the robot will be able to understand and record the textual
transcription of the what the child says (multi-lingual speech recognition),
the robot itself is purposefully designed *not* to speak, using instead *non-verbal*
communication mechanisms (non-verbal utterances using sounds, gaze, joint
attention, expressive motions, etc). In particular, the *soundscape* of the
robot will be designed by Dave Meckin, an expert on sound design for vulnerable
children. The purpose is to create an approachable, non-threatening,
non-judgmental, *social* interaction with the child, and effectively establish
the interaction into a trusted physical and emotional *safe-space* for the
child.

The work will initially focus on one-to-one interactions, and might evolve
towards interactions with small groups (2-3) of children if deemed desirable
after the first field deployments.

Another critical aspect of the project relates to how the robot will store and
protect the potentially highly sensitive data that is recorded during the
interactions. Data will only be stored on the robot itself (no external cloud
storage), and records will be strongly encrypted (i.e. even if the robot is
seized, the data will not be accessible). We will research secure, yet
child-friendly, mechanisms to identify the child and ensure that only her/him
can access her/his personal data. This will likely involve a combination of
picture-based passwords and facial recognition.

The created digital record will ultimately belong to the child. We will research
and create practical means (paper copy, bracelet with a SD card,...) for the
child to access this record when he needs it, and take it with her/him, even
after she/he has left the camp or safe-house. The devised solution will have to
ensure that no abuse or misuse of the record against the child is possible.

### Why do you think this approach will be effective?

*2100 characters including spaces*

Our approach is very novel, and untested in the context of refugees. The project
is however grounded in the extensive field experience of the partners: we have
strong evidence that art-based therapy is an effective, cross-cultural way of
engaging vulnerable populations in general, and refugee children in particular.
Such an approach has been developed and established for years by ArtRefuge UK,
resulting in stories being retold, though e.g. exhibitions **[to be
completed!]** <https://bit.ly/2Oumqfp>.  We also build on the evidence gathered
in the Trove project regarding storytelling and recording **[to be completed, in
particular Trove + refugees]**.  Finally, S√©verin Lemaignan has 10+ years of
experience creating and using social robots with children (see for instance his
Cellulo <https://bit.ly/2KkNND8> and CoWriter <https://bit.ly/2K4ws2t>
projects): a large amount of scientific evidence has shown how children socially
engage with robots, and how robots can provide support, including in
storytelling scenarios (for instance, the Tega project
<https://bit.ly/2hnFczT>).  The combination of these complementary expertises
put the project in a unique position to deliver impact for the target group.

Effectiveness will be further ensured by relying on a participatory design
methodology, involving all the stakeholders from the onset of the project; also
including field testing early on in the project, relying on provisional,
off-the-self, robot platforms (for instance, Softbank Nao). This user-centered
approach is championed by Katie Winkle, who used and refined a similar approach
with therapists in her past human-robot interaction projects.



### Why do you think that this technology is the best means of addressing the need?

*2100 characters including spaces*


- charities/NGOs working with refugees in camps are massively understaffed;
  bringing small-sized autonomous robots to camps/safe-houses to record stories
  is an effective way to provide additional support to these children, in a
  cost-effective manner.
- children typically interacts easily -- often, eagerly -- with robots (robots
  are novel, exciting, etc.): the robots might be able to foster interactions
  with children who would otherwise remain withdrawn.
- the robot is a neutral, non-judgmental machine. To some children, the robot
  might be more approachable than adults (especially considering that the robot
  does not speak), and therefore better able to prompt their story-telling.
- the robot is designed to be non-threatening and ‚Äòtoy-like without being a toy‚Äô
  in order to maintain or even improve the child‚Äôs perception of being in a
  safe, trustworthy environment 
- the robots can provide additional support to significantly understaffed
  charities, interacting with children when staff are busy or attending to many
  children at once, as well as improving one-to-one interactions between
  children and the charity workers
- because current technology enables multi-lingual speech recognition, the robot
  can also understand the children in their native language, an issue faced by
  understaffed charities/NGOs who may not have enough interpreters on site.
- possibility to create a system aware of cultural differences: the robot system
  would employ technologies which offer e.g. multi-lingual support and can be
  programmed with a database of cultural information such that the system might
  offer more culturally aware and appropriate support than other interventions

- compared to a simple app on a phone/tablet: social interaction (affective
  response/nudging/...) helping the children to engage into the storytelling and
  provide emotional support/comfort

- part of the project is to create a 'private-by-design' device for vulnerable
  children, something that does not exist to date. We will make sure that the
  robot, and the digital records, can *not* be used to 'spy' or otherwise
  pressure the children; the privacy and user-control aspect of the technology
  will be of uttermost importance. Specifically, the robot will be designed in
  such a way that *only* the child can access her/his own personal records, and
  under no condition external entities can access/harvest personal data without
  full consent from the child. If deemed necessary, *plausible deniability* will
  be implemented on the robot, allowing refugees to purposefully hide the
  content of their records, plausibly denying they ever existed in the first
  place.

We are fully aware of the challenge of deploying technology in difficult
environments like a refugee camp. As such, the robot design will put an strong
emphasise on the practicalities: the hardware will be rugged, modular (so that
broken parts can easily be replaced), the robot's cover will be made out of
silicon to protect the robot against water, dust, shocks.  The robot will be
entirely self-sufficient, not requiring any specific WiFi or phone network to
operate. We aim at having a typical battery autonomy of one full day.

We plan to ensure long-term sustainability by: making the whole platform
open-hardware (so that it can be easily duplicated and modified); using a modular
hardware design, making individual parts easily replaceable; using
off-the-self components; using manufacturing process based on 3D printing, for
added accessibility. J√©r√©my Bonvoisin, senior research in sustainable and open
hardware, will supervise this aspect of the project.


### Who will be involved in delivering the work and what will they do?

*2100 characters including spaces*

The project is deeply cross sector, involving a close partnership between
technology (robotics), arts (mediated story-telling, sound design), interaction
design and privacy experts.

We have assembled a strong and diverse team, with exceptional expertise both on
working with vulnerable refugee populations, and on designing social robots. The
team comprises of a charity with extensive experience using art in refugee camps
to support refugee populations (ArtRefuge UK, led by Bobby Lloyd), an
interaction designer working on memory collection and recollection with
vulnerable children (Chlo√© Meineck), and a strong and interdisciplinary academic
team, including Dr. S√©verin Lemaignan (WizMe project leader, based at the
Bristol Robotics Lab), who will bring 10+ years of field practice in designing
and using social robots with children; Dr. Dave Meckin (University of the West
of England), senior researcher in media technologies with a unique expertise
working on sound design for vulnerable children; Dr. J√©r√©my Bonvoisin (University of Bath),
senior researcher on sustainable and open hardware development; Dr. Katie Winkle
(University of Bristol/University of the West of England), junior scientist with
a unique expertise in social robotics.

The project also includes an advisory board, with invaluable institutional
(Helen Beten, UK Refugee Council), as well as legal (Kathryn Cronin, Garden
Court Chambers) expertise.




<!-- *The project has two main sides: the creation of the social robot, and its use
with the refugee children, in refugee camps and safe houses.

Dr. S√©verin Lemaignan, senior researcher at the Bristol Robotics Lab (part of
the University of the West of England - UWE) will lead the overall project.
S√©verin has a long track record of creating and using social robots with
children. His work includes creating small interactive robots for the classroom
and designing intelligent social robot to support children with learning
disabilities. He will work in close collaboration with Chlo√© Meineck
(interaction designer at the Bristol's Pervasive Media Lab), Dr. Dave Meckin
(professional musician and senior lecturer in Creative Media), Dr. Katie Winkle
(researcher in social human-robot interaction) and a senior mechatronic engineer
(to be recruited).

Through her previous projects (most notably, Trove --
http://studiomeineck.com/trove/) Chlo√© has built a unique expertise in creating
interactive systems for vulnerable children to tell and record their personal
stories. She will lead the design of the interaction, with a special focus on
privacy issues.

Dave is leading a unique line of research on music and robotics for vulnerable
children. His role will be focused on creating the sound-based social and
affective behaviour of the robot.

Katie is a researcher in social human-robot interaction and ethical AI. Her work
focuses on the mechanisms of persuasion, and how social robots can support their
human partner when doing difficult tasks. She will lead the development of the
robot's AI, with the aim of creating a system that support and empower the
children.

The delivery of the project will be led by Art Refuge UK, a UK registered
charity led by Bobby Lloyd. Since 2006, Art Refuge UK has been using art therapy
to support refugee in refugee camps and safe houses. Since 2015, they have been
particularly active on the French-British border, leading workshops in the
Calais jungle, and then in safe houses around Calais. Art Refuge UK will be
involved from the onset with the desig...* -->

**[Adapt/adjust presentation of ArtRefuge UK]**


Established in 2006, Art Refuge UK is a small, robust charity that works through
art and art therapy with people who have been displaced due to political or
religious persecution, armed conflict, trafficking, natural disaster and/or
poverty.  

Our team of artists and art therapists is equipped to deliver dynamic,
culturally relevant and responsive programmes in a wide range of contexts across
the UK, Europe and internationally, with a longstanding history in South Asia.
We are skilled at adapting our work to support safe and imaginative spaces for
refugees, including unaccompanied minors, both in transit and once they have
reached a final destination. 

Art Refuge UK's core ethos is based upon a participatory and collaborative
practice informed by decades of individual and collective experience and skills
in the visual arts, art therapy, trauma work and psychosocial approaches. Always
working in close partnership with local and international government and
non-governmental organisations, our work largely takes place through groups and
we currently operate in London, Bristol and on the France-UK border at Calais.

We engage in public discourse through our active use of social media as an
advocacy platform as well as a place to celebrate people's creative agency;
fundraising events; exhibitions; peer-reviewed and other academic writing,
presentation of papers at conferences and delivery of arts-based psychosocial
training programmes in the UK, Europe and internationally.

Our work is underpinned by a strong team of Trustees with expertise in art
therapy, asylum law, social work with unaccompanied minors, fundraising and
communications.
