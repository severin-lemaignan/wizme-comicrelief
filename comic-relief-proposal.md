### Brief summary

*350 characters including spaces*

WizMe is a cross-disciplinary project involving art and technology. It is about
creating a small, social, friendly robot to help refugee children to turn the
experience of their journey across the world into a powerful story that they
will be able to show and tell during their journey towards asylum.


### Please describe the people who would benefit and the problems they face in their lives

*3500 characters including spaces*

- the target group of this project are migrant children (8-18 years old), still
  on the route, but relatively close to their destination (for instance, close
  to the European border, or in transit inside the EU). We specifically plan to
  deliver the project in locations where ArtRefuge UK is actively working with
  children refugees (namely, safe-houses on the British-French border [or?]).
- the intervention is targeting children that stay a least a week in the camp or
  safe-house.
- for many of these children, the hope is to reach the UK. They face a long and
  difficult asylum seeking process.
- critical parts of this process rely on the story of their life and journey
  that the children will recount. Critically, the story has to be perceived as
  *genuine* -- it is otherwise often dismissed by border enforcement forces as
  being fake (e.g. "you are only parroting what the smuggler told you to say!")
- proving that their story is genuine is incredibly difficult for these
  children: not only they might have very little -- if any -- physical evidences
  of their journey (typically, only pictures on their smartphones -- when the
  smartphones themselves are not destroyed or confiscated by intermediaries or
  police forces), but also the children lack the skills required to tell a
  story. They typically originate from small rural communities, and they have
  had very limited need (and opportunity) to tell someone else the story of
  their daily lives in a rich and detailed manner -- something that is however
  expected from them when seeking asylum.
- asylum seekers are requested to tell their story multiple times on their
  pathway to asylum.  They will have to recount over and over again the same,
  often traumatic, journey. Compounded with stress and exhaustion, this often lead
  to small inconsistencies in the narration, that might be picked up to dismiss
  the whole case. In these situations, the balance of powers is gravely titled in
  favour of the law enforcement agencies, with little options for the children
  to appeal.
- the Refugee Convention is about assessing vulnerability of children if they
  were to return to their home country. As such most of the interviews while
  requesting asylum are about assessing/measuring weaknesses/vulnerabilities of
  children, instead of their strength/resilience while they travelled the world.
  This creates an additional trauma, compounded by the need to explain multiple
  times these weaknesses over the course of the asylum seeking process.

### What changes do you expect to see as result of your proposed work?

*3500 characters including spaces*

- the primary purpose of the project is to provide direct **support to the
  refugee children in their journey towards being granted asylum**.
- we want to achieve this by empowering the children: supporting them in
  building the story of their life and journey, and helping them in becoming the
  **confident and genuine storytellers** they need to be when narrating their
  story to institutions and government officers.
- by telling her/his story to the robot, the robot will also create a **digital
  record** of the journey, privately and securely stored, but available to the
  child as a future evidence, testimony of her/his life experience.
- By creating and providing the refugees a durable, secure and tamper-proof
  digital record of their lives, we aim at shifting the power to the asylum
  seekers: they will have *one*, *opposable* multi-media record that they can
  replay at will.
- also, positive impact on **mental health**, at two levels: alleviate some of
  the stress of the asylum seeking process (the digital record as an trustworthy
  anchor); the peaceful, non-judgmental, culturally-sensitive interaction with
  the robot as a source of comfort.
- refugee children are asked to fit in a new identity, matching local
  norms/expectation, at the cost of the previous, original identity. This is a
  source of suffering: importance of **securing identity**, as done by some
  schools (example of school inviting parents of diverse background to come and
  cook home dishes at school, with different background every week). Using
  carefully designed multi-modal interaction, the robot will invite the child to
  create her/his own narrative, using her/his cultural codes, **helping the
  children to secure their cultural identity**. Besides, by creating a lasting
  record of these story, the project contributes in build a **cultural legacy**
  for the refugees, both personal (*the story of their own journey*) and global
  (*slices of the refugees' lives*)
- the project is also about collecting and recording the **individual stories of
  unique individualities**, not just 'the refugees'. By recording, and later,
  retelling those unique stories, the project will help the children to be aware
  and proud of their **individual identities**.
- beyond the immediate role of the robot in supporting the children during the
  asylum application process, the project aims more broadly at projecting a
  **positive light** on these children, with their own complex, rich stories.

### What specifically will you do to help people to address their identified problems?

*3500 characters including spaces*

WizMe is about creating a small, social, friendly robot to help refugee children
to turn the complex experience of their journey across the world into a powerful
story that they will be able to show and tell while seeking asylum.

The robots (we plan to build a total of five units over the course of the
project) will be used by field practitioners (primarily by ArtRefuge UK, with
possible extension to other charities and NGOs) in refugee camps and safe-houses
across Europe to support the children. Supported by the staff, the robot and the
child engage into a non-threatening social interaction, in which the child is
invited, little by little, to recount her/his journey and personal life. The
duration and frequency of the interventions is flexible and would be tailored to
each child's needs; over the course of one to three weeks, we would typically
envision one 30-min long interaction every day.

Following the ArtRefuge approach, as well as the interactions created by Chlo√©
Meineck on her previous Trove project, the child is invited to tell her/his
story in many different way, using a variety of supports: narration, drawings,
paintings, plasticine, small toy figures, etc. The robot records (pictures,
videos, sounds) these representations, and also actively engage with the child,
showing curiosity, non-judgmental emotional responses, and nudging the child to
tell more, show more.

Critically, while the robot will be able to understand and record the textual
transcription of the what the child tells (multi-lingual speech recognition),
the robot itself will purposefully *not* speak, using instead *non-verbal*
communication mechanisms (non-verbal utterances using sounds, gaze, joint
attention, communicative motions, etc). In particular, the *soundscape* of the
robot will be designed by Dave Meckin, an expert on sound design for vulnerable
children. The purpose is to create an approachable, non-threatening,
non-judgmental, *social* interaction with the child, and effectively establish
the interaction into a trusted physical and emotional *safe-space* for the
child.

The work will initially focus on one-to-one interactions, and might evolve
towards interactions with small groups (2-3) of children if deemed desirable
after the first field deployments.

The robot design will put an strong emphasise on the practicalities of using
technology in difficult environments like a refugee camp: the hardware will be
rugged, modular (so that broken parts can easily be replaced), the robot's cover
will be made out of silicon to protect the robot against water, dust, shocks.
The robot will be entirely self-sufficient, not requiring any specific wifi or
phone network to operate. We aim at having a typical battery autonomy of one
full day.

Another critical aspect of the project relates to how the robot will store and
protect the potentially highly sensitive data that is recorded during the
interactions. Data will only be stored on the robot itself (no external cloud
storage), and records will be strongly encrypted (ie, even if the robot is
seized, the data will not be accessible). We will research secure, yet
child-friendly, mechanisms to identify the child and ensure that only her/him
can access her/his personal data. This will likely involve a combination of
picture-based passwords and facial recognition.

### Why do you think this approach will be effective?

*2100 characters including spaces*

- to some children, might be more approachable that adults (especially considering that the robot does not speak)
- importance of creating a fully trusted environment, where the child knows he
  is in physical and psychological security. The robot is designed to be
  non-threatening, 'toy-like without being a toy',
- making sure that the robot, and the digital record can *not* be used to 'spy'
  or otherwise pressure the children, the privacy and user-control aspect of the
  technology will be of uttermost importance. Specifically, the robot will be
  designed in such a way that *only* the child can access her/his own personal
  records, and under no condition external entities can access/harvest personal data
  without full consent from the child. If deemed necessary, *plausible
  deniability* will be implemented on the robot, allowing refugees to purposefully hide the
  content of their records, plausibly denying they ever existed in the first place.

### Why do you think that this technology is the best means of addressing the need?

*2100 characters including spaces*


- high cultural awareness
- create a digital record to be used by the children
- additional support ('man power') for the charities
- more 1-to-1 interactions with the children
- might be perceived as non-judgmental compared to adults
- compared to a simple app on a phone/tablet: social interaction (affective response/nudging/...) helping the children to engage into the storytelling



### Who will be involved in delivering the work and what will they do?

*2100 characters including spaces*

The project is deeply cross sector, involving in a close partnership between
technology (robotics), arts (mediated story-telling, sound design), interaction
design and privacy experts.

We have assembled a strong and diverse team, with exceptional expertise both on
working with vulnerable refugee populations, and on designing social robots. The
team comprises of a charity with extensive experience using art in refugee camps
to support refugee populations (ArtRefuge UK, led by Bobby Lloyd), an
interaction designer working on memory collection and recollection with
vulnerable children (Chlo√© Meineck), and a strong and interdisciplinary academic
team, including Dr. S√©verin Lemaignan (WizMe project leader, based at the
Bristol Robotics Lab), who will bring 10+ years of field practice in designing
and using social robots with children; Dr. Dave Meckin (University of the West
of England), senior researcher in media technologies with a unique expertise
working on sound design for vulnerable children; Dr. J√©r√©my Bonvoisin (University of Bath),
senior researcher on sustainable and open hardware development; Dr. Katie Winkle
(University of Bristol/University of the West of England), junior scientist with
a unique expertise in social robotics.

The project also includes an advisory board, with invaluable institutional
(Helen Beten, UK Refugee Council), as well as legal (Katheryn Cronin, Garden
Court Chambers) expertise.




<!-- *The project has two main sides: the creation of the social robot, and its use
with the refugee children, in refugee camps and safe houses.

Dr. S√©verin Lemaignan, senior researcher at the Bristol Robotics Lab (part of
the University of the West of England - UWE) will lead the overall project.
S√©verin has a long track record of creating and using social robots with
children. His work includes creating small interactive robots for the classroom
and designing intelligent social robot to support children with learning
disabilities. He will work in close collaboration with Chlo√© Meineck
(interaction designer at the Bristol's Pervasive Media Lab), Dr. Dave Meckin
(professional musician and senior lecturer in Creative Media), Dr. Katie Winkle
(researcher in social human-robot interaction) and a senior mechatronic engineer
(to be recruited).

Through her previous projects (most notably, Trove --
http://studiomeineck.com/trove/) Chlo√© has built a unique expertise in creating
interactive systems for vulnerable children to tell and record their personal
stories. She will lead the design of the interaction, with a special focus on
privacy issues.

Dave is leading a unique line of research on music and robotics for vulnerable
children. His role will be focused on creating the sound-based social and
affective behaviour of the robot.

Katie is a researcher in social human-robot interaction and ethical AI. Her work
focuses on the mechanisms of persuasion, and how social robots can support their
human partner when doing difficult tasks. She will lead the development of the
robot's AI, with the aim of creating a system that support and empower the
children.

The delivery of the project will be led by Art Refuge UK, a UK registered
charity led by Bobby Lloyd. Since 2006, Art Refuge UK has been using art therapy
to support refugee in refugee camps and safe houses. Since 2015, they have been
particularly active on the French-British border, leading workshops in the
Calais jungle, and then in safe houses around Calais. Art Refuge UK will be
involved from the onset with the desig...* -->

============================



### What is the purpose of your organisation and what are you most proud of in your history? Why is your organisation well placed to carry out this work?

*2100 characters including spaces*

The WizMe project is led by the University of the West of England. Specifically,
Dr. Lemaignan, the project leader, is one of the senior researcher of the
*Bristol Robotics Laboratory (BRL)*. The BRL is the largest co-located and most
comprehensive advanced robotics research establishment in the UK.  It is a joint
venture between the University of the West of England and the University of
Bristol. BRL's multidisciplinary approach aims to create autonomous devices
capable of working independently, with each other, or with humans. BRL draws on
robotics, electrical & mechanical engineering, computer science, psychology,
cognitive science and sociology. BRL has an international reputation as a
leading research centre in advanced robotics research and has over 250
researchers working on a broad portfolio of topics, including Human-Robot
Interaction, ethics of artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and privacy,
assistive robotics. BRL has many collaboration partnerships, both national and
international, and is experienced in managing large multi-site projects. BRL has
the additional support from two embedded units specialising in business and
enterprise, together with an incubator and successful track record of spin-outs.

The BRL, along with the department of Creative Technologies (Dr. Meckin) is in a
unique position to deliver the project technology: the BRL hosts extensive
facilities and expertise in robotic hardware development, including a large team
of technicians, industrial-grade rapid prototyping machines, a 5-axis digital
milling machine, as well as all the required equiment for mechtronic
integration. The BRL has indeed a long track-record of designing and building
new and original robots (from the BERT humanoid in the FP7 CHRIS project, to
micro-robotics \[in\...?\], to \[\...\]).  WizMe will directly benefit from this
expertise, which will ensure a feasible and realistic technical implementation
of the WizMe robots.

**[Adapt/adjust rresentation of ArtRefuge UK]**


Established in 2006, Art Refuge UK is a small, robust charity that works through
art and art therapy with people who have been displaced due to political or
religious persecution, armed conflict, trafficking, natural disaster and/or
poverty.  

Our team of artists and art therapists is equipped to deliver dynamic,
culturally relevant and responsive programmes in a wide range of contexts across
the UK, Europe and internationally, with a longstanding history in South Asia.
We are skilled at adapting our work to support safe and imaginative spaces for
refugees, including unaccompanied minors, both in transit and once they have
reached a final destination. 

Art Refuge UK's core ethos is based upon a participatory and collaborative
practice informed by decades of individual and collective experience and skills
in the visual arts, art therapy, trauma work and psychosocial approaches. Always
working in close partnership with local and international government and
non-governmental organisations, our work largely takes place through groups and
we currently operate in London, Bristol and on the France-UK border at Calais.

We engage in public discourse through our active use of social media as an
advocacy platform as well as a place to celebrate people's creative agency;
fundraising events; exhibitions; peer-reviewed and other academic writing,
presentation of papers at conferences and delivery of arts-based psychosocial
training programmes in the UK, Europe and internationally.

Our work is underpinned by a strong team of Trustees with expertise in art
therapy, asylum law, social work with unaccompanied minors, fundraising and
communications.
