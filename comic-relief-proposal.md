### Brief summary

*350 characters including spaces*

WizMe is a cross-disciplinary project involving art and technology. It is about
creating a small, social, friendly robot to help refugee children to turn the
experience of their journey across the world into a powerful story that they
will be able to show and tell during their journey to asylum.


### Please describe the people who would benefit and the problems they face in their lives

*3500 characters including spaces*

- the target group of this project are migrant children (8-18 years old), still
  on the route, but relatively close to their destinations (for instance, close
  to the European border, or in transit inside the EU). We specifically plan to
  deliver the project in locations where ArtRefuge UK is actively working with
  children refugees (namely, safe-houses on the British-French border [...]).
- for many of these children, the hope is to reach the UK. They face a long and
  difficult asylm seeking process
- critical parts of this process rely on the story of their life and journey
  that the children can narrate. Critically, the stories are repeatedly
  dismissed by border enforcement forces as being fake (eg "you are only
  parroting what the smuggler told you to say!")
- proving that their story is genuine is incredibly difficult for these
  children: not only they might have very little -- if any -- physical evidences
  of their journey (typically, only pictures on their smartphones -- when the
  smartphones themselves are not destroyed or confiscated by intermediaries or
  police forces), but also the children lack the skills required to tell a
  story. They typically originate from small rural communities, and they have
  had very limited need (and opportunity) to tell someone else the story of
  their daily lives in a rich and detailed manner -- something that is however
  expected from them when seeking asylum.

### What changes do you expect to see as result of your proposed work?

*3500 characters including spaces*

- the primary purpose of the project is to provide direct **support to the refugee
  children in their journey towards being granted asylum**.
- we want to achieve this by empowering the children: supporting them in
  building the story of their life and journey, and helping them in becoming the
  **confident and genuine storytellers** they need to be when narrating their
  story to institutions and government officers.
- by telling her/his story to the robot, the robot will also create a **digital
  record** of the journey, privately and securely stored in the robot, but
  available to the child as a future evidence, testimony of her/his life
  experience.
- refugee children are asked to fit in a new identity, matching local
  norms/expectation, at the cost of the previous, original identity. This is a
  source of suffering: importance of *securing identity*, as done by some
  schools (example of school inviting parents of diverse background to come and
  cook home dishes at school, with different background every week). Using
  carefully designed multi-modal interaction, the robot will invite the child to
  create her/his own narrative, using her/his cultural codes, **helping the
  children to secure their cultural identity**. Besides, by creating a lasting
  record of these story, the project contributes in build a **cultural legacy**
  for the refugees, both personal (*the story of their own journey*) and global
  (*slices of the refugees' lives*)
- the project is also about collecting and recording the **individual stories of
  unique individualities**, not just 'the refugees'. By recording, and later,
  retelling those unique stories, the project will help the children to be aware
  and proud of their **individual identities**.
- beyond the immediate role of the robot in supporting the children during the
  asylum application process, the project aims more broadly at projecting a
  **positive light** on these children, with their own complex, rich stories.

### What specifically will you do to help people to address their identified problems?

*3500 characters including spaces*

WizMe is about creating a small, social, friendly robot to help refugee children
to turn the experience of their journey across the world into a powerful story
that they will be able to show and tell during their journey to asylum.

The project is deeply cross sector, involving in a tight partnership between
technology (robotics), arts (mediated story-telling, sound design), interaction
design and privacy experts.

We will create a small social companion robot,

WizMe will develop and demonstrate the need for a global approach to
social HRI with an ambitious, high-impact, socially meaningful
application. Over the duration of the project, I will create a new
companion robot to support young, isolated refugees in their
asylum-seeking process.

The robots will be used by field practitioners (charities and NGO) in
refugee camps and safe-houses across Europe to support the children by
offering a one-to-one social interaction, in their language. The robots
will be designed in close cooperation with designers and visual artists
with exceptional knowledge of the refugees' realities, and one of the
key role of the robots will be to collect the children's stories, as
these stories are

, designed from the ground-up with privacy and stringent ethical
principles

migrant children who might lack the otherwise needed support for a
successful integration (different cultures and social norms; absence of
local, culturally integrated, relatives; language barriers; etc.).

Importance of establishing long-term trust; relation to privacy.


### Why do you think this approach will be effective?

*2100 characters including spaces*



### Why do you think that this technology is the best means of addressing the need?

*2100 characters including spaces*

- to some children, might be more approachable that adults (especially considering that the robot does not speak)
- high cultural awareness
- create a digital record to be used by the children
- additional support ('man power') for the charities
- more 1-to-1 interactions with the children
- might be perceived as non-judgmental compared to adults
- compared to a simple app on a phone/tablet: social interaction (affective response/nudging/...) helping the children to engage into the storytelling



### Who will be involved in delivering the work and what will they do?

*2100 characters including spaces*


WizMe is an interdisciplinary endeavour, and requires several complementary
expertises to be successful. We have assembled a strong and diverse team, with
exceptional expertise both on working with vulnerable refugee populations, and
on designing social robots. The team comprises of a charity with extensive
experience using art in refugee camps to support refugee populations (ArtRefuge
UK, led by Bobby Lloyd), an interaction designer working on memory collection
and recollection with vulnerable children (Chloé Meineck), and a strong and
interdisciplinary academic team, including Dr. Séverin Lemaignan (WizMe project
leader, based at the Bristol Robotics Lab), who will bring 10+ years of field
practice in designing and using social robots with children; Dr. Dave Meckin
(University of the West of England), senior researcher in media technologies
with a unique expertise working with vulnerable children; Dr. Jérémy Bonvoisin
(University of Bath), senior researcher on sustainable and open hardware
development; Dr. Katie Winkle (University of Bristol/University of the West of
England), junior scientist with a unique expertise in social robotics.

The project also includes an advisory board, with invaluable institutional
(Helen Beten, UK Refugee Council), as well as legal (Katheryn Cronin, Garden
Court Chambers) expertise.




*The project has two main sides: the creation of the social robot, and its use
with the refugee children, in refugee camps and safe houses.

Dr. Séverin Lemaignan, senior researcher at the Bristol Robotics Lab (part of
the University of the West of England - UWE) will lead the overall project.
Séverin has a long track record of creating and using social robots with
children. His work includes creating small interactive robots for the classroom
and designing intelligent social robot to support children with learning
disabilities. He will work in close collaboration with Chloé Meineck
(interaction designer at the Bristol's Pervasive Media Lab), Dr. Dave Meckin
(professional musician and senior lecturer in Creative Media), Dr. Katie Winkle
(researcher in social human-robot interaction) and a senior mechatronic engineer
(to be recruited).

Through her previous projects (most notably, Trove --
http://studiomeineck.com/trove/) Chloé has built a unique expertise in creating
interactive systems for vulnerable children to tell and record their personal
stories. She will lead the design of the interaction, with a special focus on
privacy issues.

Dave is leading a unique line of research on music and robotics for vulnerable
children. His role will be focused on creating the sound-based social and
affective behaviour of the robot.

Katie is a researcher in social human-robot interaction and ethical AI. Her work
focuses on the mechanisms of persuasion, and how social robots can support their
human partner when doing difficult tasks. She will lead the development of the
robot's AI, with the aim of creating a system that support and empower the
children.

The delivery of the project will be led by Art Refuge UK, a UK registered
charity led by Bobby Lloyd. Since 2006, Art Refuge UK has been using art therapy
to support refugee in refugee camps and safe houses. Since 2015, they have been
particularly active on the French-British border, leading workshops in the
Calais jungle, and then in safe houses around Calais. Art Refuge UK will be
involved from the onset with the desig...*


Section 3: Your organisation
============================



### What is the purpose of your organisation and what are you most proud of in your history? Why is your organisation well placed to carry out this work?

*2100 characters including spaces*

The WizMe project is led by the University of the West of England. Specifically,
Dr. Lemaignan, the project leader, is one of the senior researcher of the
*Bristol Robotics Laboratory (BRL)*. The BRL is the largest co-located and most
comprehensive advanced robotics research establishment in the UK.  It is a joint
venture between the University of the West of England and the University of
Bristol. BRL's multidisciplinary approach aims to create autonomous devices
capable of working independently, with each other, or with humans. BRL draws on
robotics, electrical & mechanical engineering, computer science, psychology,
cognitive science and sociology. BRL has an international reputation as a
leading research centre in advanced robotics research and has over 250
researchers working on a broad portfolio of topics, including Human-Robot
Interaction, ethics of artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and privacy,
assistive robotics. BRL has many collaboration partnerships, both national and
international, and is experienced in managing large multi-site projects. BRL has
the additional support from two embedded units specialising in business and
enterprise, together with an incubator and successful track record of spin-outs.

The BRL, along with the department of Creative Technologies (Dr. Meckin) is in a
unique position to deliver the project technology: the BRL hosts extensive
facilities and expertise in robotic hardware development, including a large team
of technicians, industrial-grade rapid prototyping machines, a 5-axis digital
milling machine, as well as all the required equiment for mechtronic
integration. The BRL has indeed a long track-record of designing and building
new and original robots (from the BERT humanoid in the FP7 CHRIS project, to
micro-robotics \[in\...?\], to \[\...\]).  WizMe will directly benefit from this
expertise, which will ensure a feasible and realistic technical implementation
of the WizMe robots.
